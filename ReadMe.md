# Welcome to My Personal Website Project 🎉

## What is this?
This is my personal website project built using **React Native** and **Expo**, designed to run smoothly on both iOS and the web! You’ll find some exciting things here like:
- A **Home Page** that welcomes you with open arms (or at least open tags).
- A **Games Page** that currently does not include "Flappy Bird", but we’re working on it! 🎮
- A **Products Page** where you’ll find all the products I may or may not ever sell. 🛒
- And much more to come... probably!

## Features
- **Cross-platform**: Works on iOS, Android, and Web, because we believe in equal opportunity bugs!
- **Tab Navigation**: Smooth like butter, and doesn’t get stuck (hopefully).
- **Reusable Components**: Because we love recycling code, not just bottles.
- **Global Styling**: Consistent looks across pages because, let’s face it, nobody likes style drama.
- **Footer**: Yes, we even have a footer. Contact me there if you’re feeling curious.

## How to Use
- **Home Page**: It’s where you’ll feel at home (unless you were looking for Facebook).
- **Games Page**: A placeholder for now, but stay tuned for some exciting games that might totally blow your mind (or at least mildly entertain you).
- **Products Page**: The ultimate destination for things I might sell if I figure out what those are.

## Coding Style Guide
For a full rundown of how we code here in this project, check out the **CodingStyle.md** file. If you don’t follow it, we won’t be mad—just a bit disappointed.

## Known Bugs 🐛
- Sometimes the website works too perfectly—it’s unnerving.
- Occasional hiccups when switching between tabs. Think of it as the website's way of keeping you on your toes.

## Contact
If you want to reach out, find me in the footer... where all good contacts live.
